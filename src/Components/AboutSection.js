					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>
						Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue
						their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
						<br />
						<br />
						To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
						marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate
						additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
